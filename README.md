speakpad
========

Android app for using the voice synthesizer to speak what you type.

I had throat surgery not too long ago and had to spend about a month on
vocal rest.  Right after the surgery, I wrote this app and used it to speak
for me quite a bit.  Combined with Swype and a Bluetooth stereo adapter
in my house, I was able to communicate pretty effectively.
